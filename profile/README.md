### ⚙️ What We Do

At t8nlab we builds **system-grade infrastructure for JavaScript**.

We design runtime architecture that compiles JavaScript into native Rust-powered binaries — removing traditional Node.js deployment constraints and enabling deterministic, multi-threaded execution at scale.

Our focus:
- 🧵 True multi-threaded JavaScript
- ⚡ Deterministic execution model
- 🦀 Rust-powered runtime core
- 📦 Native production binaries
- 🔒 Predictable backend infrastructure

## 🚀 TitanPL

**TitanPL** is our flagship backend framework.

It compiles JavaScript routes and actions into a **Rust + It's Own Multi Threaded untime Gravity** server architecture using a CLI-based workflow.

Instead of:
- Event-loop bottlenecks
- Async/await complexity leaks
- Runtime dependency sprawl

TitanPL delivers:
- Multi-threaded V8 isolates
- Structured concurrency via Rust
- No Node.js required in production
- Zero-overhead ESM native APIs
- Deterministic request execution

Build backends.  
Ship a single native binary.

## 🧠 Our Vision

JavaScript should not be limited by single-threaded runtime history.

We are rebuilding backend JavaScript around:
- Parallelism as a foundation
- Systems-level architecture
- Predictable performance
- Infrastructure-first design

This is not a just framework layer.

This is a runtime evolution.
